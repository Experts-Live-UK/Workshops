# Zero Trust & Endpoint Security Workshop – Hands-on Lab

This repository provides step-by-step guidance for the **Zero Trust & Endpoint Security Workshop**. Attendees can follow along, perform hands-on exercises, and revisit these materials for future reference.

## 1️⃣ Zero Trust with Microsoft  

### What is Zero Trust?  
Zero Trust is Microsoft’s security model that assumes **breach by default** and enforces **explicit verification** for every access request. Instead of relying on traditional perimeter-based security, Zero Trust:  

- **Verifies explicitly** – Authenticates users, devices, and apps based on all available data points.  
- **Uses least privilege access** – Grants users only the minimum access needed to perform their roles.  
- **Assumes breach** – Continuously monitors for threats and enforces real-time security responses.  

Microsoft implements Zero Trust through **Entra ID (formerly Azure AD), Intune, Defender for Endpoint, and Microsoft Sentinel**, ensuring **identity, device, and app security** across the enterprise.

---

## 2️⃣ Zero Trust Readiness Assessment  

Microsoft provides a **Zero Trust Readiness Assessment** tool to help organisations evaluate their Zero Trust maturity. The assessment analyzes your **identity, devices, network, applications, data, and security operations** to provide recommendations.

### How to Use the Assessment:  
1. Navigate to **[Zero Trust Readiness Assessment](https://microsoft.github.io/zerotrustassessment/docs/app-permissions)**.  
2. Open PowerShell 7 on your device, and install the module following the steps provided in the link.   
3. Run the assessment and review recommendations.

---

## 3️⃣ Enterprise Access Model & Privileged Access Strategy  

The **Enterprise Access Model (EAM)** is Microsoft’s **modern approach to privileged access management**, ensuring administrators follow strict security practices.  

### Key Privileged Access Tiers:  
1. **Enterprise Security** – Baseline security for standard IT admins with MFA and Conditional Access.  
2. **Specialized Security** – Advanced protections for high-risk accounts, enforcing **Privileged Access Workstations (PAWs)**.  
3. **Privileged Security** – Maximum security for **Tier 0 identities**, requiring **Just-in-Time (JIT) access** and continuous monitoring.

The EAM aligns with **Zero Trust principles**, ensuring privileged users operate under **least privilege and risk-based access controls**.

---

## 4️⃣ Intune Management Tool  

**Intune Manager** is an open-source tool that simplifies policy management in Microsoft Intune. It helps organisations:  
- **Backup configurations** – Export Intune policies for disaster recovery.  
- **Version control policies** – Track and manage policy changes over time.  
- **Deploy and replicate policies** – Import/export settings across multiple tenants.  
- **Document policies** – Maintain records of compliance and security baselines.

More details: **[Intune Manager GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Micke-K/IntuneManagement)**.

---

## 5️⃣ Using Intune Manager  

### How to Use Intune Manager:  
1. Download the latest **Intune Manager** release from [GitHub](https://github.com/Micke-K/IntuneManagement).  
2. Extract the downloadeded zip file.
3. Unblock all .cmd and .ps/psm/psd files - **You can do this by right clicking the file and selecting the Unblock checkbox**
4. Open PowerShell 7 and navigate to the folder - **Example: cd C:\Temp\IntuneManagement-master**
5. Run the tool by typing **.\start-Intunemanagement.ps1**
6. Using the profile icon in the top right, sign in using your global admin account
7. Accept any graph permissions required.
8. Select the profile icon again, and choose request consent, approve these again.
9. From here you can select the required module and export/import or document policy configurations.

## 6️⃣ Security Baselines for Intune  

Security baselines in Intune provide **pre-configured security settings** to enforce compliance across Windows devices.  

### Available Security Baselines:  
1. **Native Intune Baselines** – Microsoft provides built-in baselines aligned with Windows security best practices.  
2. **Community Security Baselines** – Open-source baseline templates, such as those from the **Open Intune Baseline Project**.

---

## 7️⃣ Community Security Baselines  

For this workshop, we will use **community-provided baselines** to quickly apply **secure configurations**.  

🔗 **Baseline Repository:** [Open Intune Baseline](https://github.com/SkipToTheEndpoint/OpenIntuneBaseline).  

### Import the required policies using the Intune Management tool

## 8️⃣ Introduction to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint  

**Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE)** is a comprehensive **endpoint detection and response (EDR) solution** that helps organisations:  
- Detect and respond to advanced threats.  
- Manage endpoint vulnerabilities.  
- Automate security investigations and response actions.  
- Integrate security alerts with **Microsoft Sentinel** and **Microsoft 365 Defender**.

---

## 9️⃣ Onboarding to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint with Intune  

To onboard devices to **Defender for Endpoint**, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Microsoft Defender Portal** (https://security.microsoft.com) > **Settings** > **Endpoints** > **Advanced Features** > **Microsoft Intune**
2. Enable the toggle for the **Microsoft Intune** connection.
3. Go to **Microsoft Intune Portal** > **Tenant Administration** > **Connectors and Tokens** > **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**

5. Go to **Endpoint Security** node in Intune > **Endpoint detection and response** and create a new policy with the below settings.
6. Assign the policy to your target devices.  
7. Verify successful onboarding in the **Microsoft Defender portal**.
