## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Zero Trust with Microsoft  

### What is Zero Trust?  
Zero Trust is Microsoft‚Äôs security model that assumes **breach by default** and enforces **explicit verification** for every access request. Instead of relying on traditional perimeter-based security, Zero Trust:  

- **Verifies explicitly** ‚Äì Authenticates users, devices, and apps based on all available data points.  
- **Uses least privilege access** ‚Äì Grants users only the minimum access needed to perform their roles.  
- **Assumes breach** ‚Äì Continuously monitors for threats and enforces real-time security responses.  

Microsoft implements Zero Trust through **Entra ID (formerly Azure AD), Intune, Defender for Endpoint, and Microsoft Sentinel**, ensuring **identity, device, and app security** across the enterprise.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Zero Trust Readiness Assessment  

Microsoft provides a **Zero Trust Readiness Assessment** tool to help organisations evaluate their Zero Trust maturity. The assessment analyzes your **identity, devices, network, applications, data, and security operations** to provide recommendations.

### How to Use the Assessment:  
1. Navigate to **[Zero Trust Readiness Assessment](https://microsoft.github.io/zerotrustassessment/docs/app-permissions)**.  
2. Open PowerShell 7 on your device, and install the module following the steps provided in the link.   
3. Run the assessment and review recommendations.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Enterprise Access Model & Privileged Access Strategy  

The **Enterprise Access Model (EAM)** is Microsoft‚Äôs **modern approach to privileged access management**, ensuring administrators follow strict security practices.  

### Key Privileged Access Tiers:  
1. **Enterprise Security** ‚Äì Baseline security for standard IT admins with MFA and Conditional Access.  
2. **Specialized Security** ‚Äì Advanced protections for high-risk accounts, enforcing **Privileged Access Workstations (PAWs)**.  
3. **Privileged Security** ‚Äì Maximum security for **Tier 0 identities**, requiring **Just-in-Time (JIT) access** and continuous monitoring.

The EAM aligns with **Zero Trust principles**, ensuring privileged users operate under **least privilege and risk-based access controls**.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Intune Management Tool  

**Intune Manager** is an open-source tool that simplifies policy management in Microsoft Intune. It helps organisations:  
- **Backup configurations** ‚Äì Export Intune policies for disaster recovery.  
- **Version control policies** ‚Äì Track and manage policy changes over time.  
- **Deploy and replicate policies** ‚Äì Import/export settings across multiple tenants.  
- **Document policies** ‚Äì Maintain records of compliance and security baselines.
